# ------------------------
# Rules to abide:
# 1. Keywords Test, Author, Date, Time, Mode, Question can be used in any order and in any place of the text
# 2. Keywords Value, Answer, Answer+ are ignored if placed before keyword Question
# 3. Keywords Value, Answer, Answer+ are considered to be related to the latest occurence of the Question keyword
#
# Test name
Test = Example test
# Test author
Author = s4rduk4r
# Creation/Modification date. Must be in format DD.MM.YYYY
Date = 03.10.2017
# Test time in seconds. Note that this is a time for the whole test.
# Below is the time of 15 minutes
Time = 900
# Wrong answers can be considered as punishment 
# worth question value divided on all wrong answers
# This can be set by using Mode = Punish
Mode = Punish
# If you don't want such behaviour, then use Mode = Loyal
Mode = Loyal
# Each question begins with keyword Question
# Every keyword Answer is counted towards the latest encountered Question keyword.
Question = Here goes the question text
# Value tells how much points given question is worth
# In example below the question is worth 10 points
# Value must be positive, otherwise it's treated as zero
Value = 10
Answer = Some answer
Answer = Another answer
Answer = And here's one more
# Correct answers are marked by + suffix
Answer+ = This answer is correct one
# There can be more than one correct answer
Answer+ = This is a correct answer too
Question = This is the second question
# The order in which you mark an answer as a correct one doesn't matter.
# All answers are shuffled and each time are given in a random order.
# Same applies to the questions.
Answer = Answer text 1
Answer+ = Answer text 2
Answer = Answer text 3
Answer+ = Answer text 4
# It's better to leave an empty line at the end of the file
